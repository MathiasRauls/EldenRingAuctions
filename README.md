# Elden Ring Auctions

![alt text](https://github.com/MathiasRauls/portfolio/blob/main/eldenring.PNG)

I made this website for a school project that focused on creating an Ebay-like Ecommerce site. Thrilled by this challenge I settled on the idea of an NFT marketplace that allows players of the game **Elden Ring** to sell their weapons for **cryptocurrency**.

While building this project I learned a lot about the **Django** framework and using **Python** to take user input and write **SQL** queries to a database. I learned more about CSS and how to effectively **query for data** to be dynamically displayed on the page using **Jinga** inheritance. I also discovered how I can create a secure user login portal to allow anyone who is logged in the ability to post their own items for sale. Any user signed in, can make a bid on any listed item, comment on any post, and even add/remove a product into their own watchlists.

My project stands out because of its interesting and original design and concept.
