# Elden Ring Auctions

I made this website for a school project that focused on creating an Ebay-like Ecommerce site. Thrilled by this challenge I settled on the idea of an NFT marketplace that allows players of the game *Elden Ring* to sell their weapons for **cryptocurrency**.

While building this project I learned a lot about the **Django** framework and using **Python** to take user input and write **SQL** queries to a database. I learned more about CSS and how to effectively **query for data** to be dynamically displayed on the page using **Jinga** inheritance. I also discovered how I can create a secure user login portal to allow anyone who is logged in the ability to post their own items for sale.

My project stands out because of its interesting and original design and concept.
